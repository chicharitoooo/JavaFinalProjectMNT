The game was created during the summer of 1965 on Bainbridge Island.

The first games were held at regular desks, books were installed instead of a grid. Rackets served pieces of cardboard. Later came the net and rackets of various shapes. The game began to rapidly gain popularity.

And now it is the one of the most popular games in all over the world.

THE GAME IS  racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent or between two teams of two players each In fact, everything is so, but I have a boring game, in order to occupy ourselves for a short time, if we are sitting around and do not want to strain our heads.

But it also have positive affects on people. Helps to increase concentration and learn how to correctly calculate the angles.
